### **Step-by-Step Approach**

1. **Start with the Basics:**

   - [ X ] Set up the database schema
   - [ X ] Ensure basic operations (creating users making trades, etc.).
   - [ X ] Set up the job queue using Laravel’s basic queue system (e.g., database driver).

2. **Implement Queue Jobs:**

   - [ X ] Use a cron job or basic queue worker to process queued jobs.
   - [ X ] Set up jobs for:
     - [ ] Processing trades (buy/sell orders). Look into doing DB Transactions to lock rows from being picked up or updated multiple times. 1 Worker 1 Job.
     - [ ] Updating stock prices periodically.
     - [ ] Sending notifications (e.g., trade completion, price alerts) using Laravel Echo.

2a. **Buy/ Sell Orders**

- [ ] Implement Buy Logic. Update User Portfolio. Add to User Transaction History. Validation is SUPER HUGE here. Make sure to think of iteration
- [ ] Implement Sell Logic. Same as Buy Logic. Again validation is SUPER HUGE here. Probably want to do things in DB transactions for both
- [ ] Look into sending a simple notification for now. Maybe just use like alpine or interia to do it then use laravel echo later. Or maybe just send an email idk. probably both tbh

1. **Keep the Logic Simple:**

   - [ ] Ensure trade processing jobs only mark trades as completed or failed.
   - [ ] Keep the first iteration minimal—avoid unnecessary complexity.

2. **Run and Test Locally:**

   - [ ] Test all functionalities locally before deploying.
   - [ ] Run cron jobs locally and verify job processing.

3. **Implement Error Handling and Retry Logic:**

   - [ ] Set up basic retry logic (e.g., `--tries=3`).
   - [ ] Monitor failed jobs using `php artisan queue:failed`.
   - [ ] Enable manual retries using `php artisan queue:retry`.

4. **Optimize Later:**

   - [ ] Consider Laravel Horizon for better queue management.
   - [ ] Integrate Laravel Echo for real-time updates and notifications.
   - [ ] Use Laravel Forge for automated deployments when ready.

5. **Job Queue Processing:**

   - [ X ] Set up a cron job for queue processing.
   - [ X ] Ensure understanding of `queue:work`, `queue:listen`, job classes, etc.

6. **Database Structure:**

   - [ X ] Create tables for users, trades, portfolios, and queued jobs.
   - [ X ] Set up key relationships:
     - [ X ] User ↔ Portfolio.
     - [ X ] Portfolio ↔ Trades.
     - [ X ] Stock ↔ Market History.

7. **Basic Authentication:**

   - [ X ] Use Laravel’s built-in authentication for user sign-ups, logins, and access control.
   - [ X ] Track user actions and history for reporting and auditing.

8. **Basic Notifications:**

- [ ] Set up simple email or database notifications for trade confirmations.
- [ ] Add a queue job for background notification processing.
- [ ] Implement in-app alerts (e.g., bell icon) using Laravel Echo.

### **Incremental Steps After Foundation is Set**

11. **Queue Failures & Retries:**

- [ ] Improve error handling, retries, and tracking for failed jobs.

12. **Security & Validation:**

- [ ] Add stricter validation for user input.
- [ ] Implement security measures like CSRF protection.

13. **User Interface:**

- [ ] Build a basic dashboard for managing portfolios, trades, and stocks.

14. **Scaling:**

- [ ] Monitor and optimize performance as user load increases.
- [ ] Use caching, optimize database queries, and scale the queue system (e.g., Redis, SQS).
