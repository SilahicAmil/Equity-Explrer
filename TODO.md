Step-by-Step Approach

1. Start with the Basics:
    * Set up the database schema and ensuring you can perform basic operations like creating users, adding
      stocks, making trades, etc.
    * Set up the job queue using Laravel’s basic queue system (e.g., database driver), where you process jobs in the
      background.
2. Implement Queue Jobs:
    * For now, use a cron job or the basic queue worker to process queued jobs.
    * Set up jobs for actions like:
        * Processing trades (buy/sell orders)
        * Updating stock prices (if you want to periodically update stock prices or other metrics)
        * Sending notifications (e.g., when a trade is completed or a stock reaches a certain price) (Laravel Echo)
3. Keep the Logic Simple:
    * For the first iteration, keep the logic around your jobs as simple as possible. For example, the trade processing
      job just needs to mark trades as completed or failed.
    * Don’t worry about scaling or adding more complexity until the basic functionality is in place.
4. Run and Test Locally:
    * Test everything locally first. You can run your cron jobs in your local environment and verify that the jobs are
      being processed as expected.
    * Use Laravel’s built-in logging and queue monitoring to track job execution and failures.
5. Implement Error Handling and Retry Logic:
    * Set up basic retry logic (e.g., --tries=3) to handle failed jobs.
    * You can also manually check failed jobs by using php artisan queue:failed and retry them using php artisan queue:
      retry.
6. Optimize Later:
    * Once your basic setup works, start looking into optimizations:
        * Laravel Horizon: When you're ready to scale and monitor your queues better, you can introduce Laravel Horizon
          for a more advanced and user-friendly queue management system.
        * Laravel Echo: For real-time features like notifications or updates, Laravel Echo can be integrated.
        * Laravel Forge: Once your system is ready for production, Forge can help automate server setup, deployments,
          and scaling.
          Things to Focus on Early on:
1. Job Queue Processing:
    * Set up your cron job to process queued jobs.
    * Make sure you understand the basics of Laravel’s queue system (queue:work, queue:listen, job classes, etc.).
2. Database Structure:
    * Get your tables set up, including users, trades, portfolios, and the queueable jobs.
    * Focus on key relationships like user <-> portfolio, portfolio <-> trades, and stock <-> market history.
3. Basic Authentication:
    * Use Laravel’s built-in authentication to manage user sign-ups, logins, and access control.
    * Track user actions and history for later reporting and auditing.
4. Basic Notifications:
    * Set up simple email or database notifications that inform users of trade confirmations or other relevant events.
    * If needed, you can add a queue job to send notifications in the background (e.g., after a trade completes).

1. Queue Failures & Retries:
    * Once the basics are up and running, focus on error handling, retries, and tracking failed jobs.
2. Security & Validation:
    * As you handle real transactions (buying/selling), start validating input more rigorously, adding more security
      layers (e.g., CSRF protection, input validation, etc.).
3. User Interface:
    * After the back-end logic is in place, you can focus on building the front end, either with a basic admin dashboard
      or a user-facing dashboard to manage portfolios, trades, and stocks.
4. Scaling:
    * As you start processing more trades or users, keep an eye on performance. Look at caching, optimizing database
      queries, and scaling the queue system (e.g., moving to Redis or using SQS).
